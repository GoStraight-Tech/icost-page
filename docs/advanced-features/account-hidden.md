# Account Hidden

When an asset is no longer in use, it is recommended to hide it so that the asset list will not be seen.

Hidden accounts do not appear on the billing page by default, and the corresponding bills do not appear on the **Records** and **Analysis**. If you want to display the hidden accounts and bills, you can modify them in the "**Asset Settings**" on the **Settings** page.

In addition, on the asset homepage, you can view the list of hidden assets by long pressing the small eyes of the overview card, and swiping left to "**Unhide**" and "**Edit**".
