# Auto Bookkeeping

### 1. Use templates to configure shortcut actions.

The auto bookkeeping function is attached to the template function. Users can create a template in the application. After the creation is completed, the system will automatically register the template as a shortcut action. This means that the template operation can be found in the system's **Shortcuts** app, and a shortcut instruction can be created for the operation.

After the template is configured in the application, wait for a short period of time, and you will see the corresponding action appear in the system's **Shortcuts**.

### 2. Create a custom automation.

For creating an automated process, you can refer to the GIF below. In fact, the system provides a lot of configuration options that allow various complicated preconditions,  you can learn about it.

### 3. Why choose this method to achieve auto bookkeeping?

On the one hand, the system’s **Shortcuts** are well adapted to various scenarios. The configuration of the shortcut instructions can achieve very complex automation, such as every Monday to every Friday, if the detection reaches the company’s location, it can be automatically record a transportation cost of 10 yuan. This kind of recording operation cannot be realized in the application. This is the permission advantage of the system software and should be used.

On the other hand, in almost all applications at present, the way to achieve auto bookkeeping is to insert automatic accounting data by comparing the last startup time with the current startup time and calculating the time difference. One problem with this approach is that if the user's system time is wrong, it will cause a large amount of data to be inserted into the application instantaneously, and even if this boundary condition is handled well, at least a single processing data will be lost.
