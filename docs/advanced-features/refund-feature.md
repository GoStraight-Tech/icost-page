# Refund Feature

Users can swipe the bill to the left or view the bill details page to operate the **Refund**. There are three parameter configurations for the refund operation:

1. Refund amount;
2. Refund time;
3. Refund account.

The refund amount cannot be 0, and the refund time cannot be earlier than the time of the original bill.
