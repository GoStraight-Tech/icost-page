# Transfer fee & discount

When transferring funds, you can configure handling fees/discounts. A similar configuration can also be done for repayment or collection.

![](broken-reference)

It should be noted that when a transaction fee or discount is configured, when a bill is created, a consumption expenditure for the transaction fee or a discounted income record will be directly added. Both of these records are directly applied to the transfer-out account, and the transfer-in account is not affected.
