# Bill reimbursement



The reimbursement function can manage reimbursement matters, suitable for scenarios such as company expense reimbursement/business travel reimbursement/group building reimbursement.

### 1. How to turn on the reimbursement function?

In the **Settings** page -> **Claim Settings** -> **Switch**, you can configure the general switch of reimbursement.

There are three entrances for reimbursement management.

1. **Settings** -> **Claim Settings** -> **Claim Management**;
2. **Records** -> **Claim Card** -> **Claim Management**;
3. **Analysis** -> **Claim Block** -> **Claim Management**;

### 2. How to reimburse bills?

After opening the reimbursement function, a claim option will appear on the page for adding bills. Each time you create a new expenditure bill, you can select the bill to become a "pending" bill.

In this way, the bill will appear in the **Claim** **Management**.

Select the corresponding bill to enter the subsequent reimbursement process.

During the reimbursement process, if a single bill is selected, you can select a custom amount and reimbursement time; the reimbursement time is one of the time points from the creation time of the original bill to the current time. It should be noted that when the entered custom amount is less than the reimbursable amount, a prompt option will appear:

If you select "**Stay in pending**", the system will split the bill into two bills, leaving the difference for subsequent reimbursement. If you select "**Direct claim**", the system will directly generate an expenditure bill to fill the gap.

If the custom amount filled in exceeds the amount of the original bill, an income bill will be generated directly, and the principle is the same as above.

**`It should be noted that the amount of the generated Claims(Outcome) bill will only be included in the expenditure, not the outflow of the account, because this part of the expenditure has been included in the calculation of the original reimbursement bill. In the same way, the amount of the generated Claims(Income) bill will only be included in the income, and will not be included in the inflow of the account, because this part of the income has been included in the calculation of the reimbursement. It appears in the account for the convenience of checking accounts.`**

### 3. New reimbursement portal

After version v3.5.0, two new methods for direct reimbursement of bills have been added.

1. Swipe the bill directly to the left and choose **Claims**;
2. Enter the bill details and select **Claims**.
